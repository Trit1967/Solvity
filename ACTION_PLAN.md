## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Security First (Non-Negotiable)
```python
Every feature must:
✓ Encrypt data at rest
✓ Audit all actions
✓ Isolate tenant data
✓ Pass security review
```

### 2. Performance Targets
- Query response: < 2 seconds
- Upload processing: < 10 seconds
- Uptime: 99.9% (Phase 2+)
- Zero data breaches

### 3. Customer Trust Signals
- SOC 2 badge on website
- Security page with details
- Transparency reports
- Regular security updates

## Risk Mitigation

### Top Risks & Mitigations

1. **Data Breach**
   - Mitigation: Encryption, isolation, monitoring
   - Response: Incident response plan ready

2. **Scaling Issues**
   - Mitigation: Kubernetes, auto-scaling
   - Response: Manual scaling playbook

3. **Compliance Failure**
   - Mitigation: Early audit preparation
   - Response: Compliance consultant on standby

4. **Customer Churn**
   - Mitigation: Security as differentiator
   - Response: Enterprise features roadmap

## Competition & Differentiation

### Your Security Advantages
1. **Local LLM** (Ollama) - Data never leaves infrastructure
2. **Tenant isolation** - True multi-tenancy from day 1
3. **Encryption by default** - Not an add-on
4. **Transparent security** - Audit logs available to customers
5. **Compliance ready** - Built for regulations

### Pricing Strategy
```
Standard competitors: $50-200/month
Your pricing with security premium:
- Starter: $39/month (includes encryption)
- Pro: $129/month (includes audit logs)
- Enterprise: $499/month (includes compliance)
```

## Remember: Start Small, But Secure

1. **Week 1**: Launch with basic security (encryption + audit)
2. **Month 1**: Add advanced security (monitoring + compliance prep)
3. **Quarter 1**: Achieve first certification (SOC 2 Type I)
4. **Year 1**: Full enterprise security stack

**Your competitive advantage isn't just RAG - it's SECURE RAG for SMBs who care about their data.**
